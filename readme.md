React interactable
-------------------

This is a port of [react-native-interactable](https://github.com/wix/react-native-interactable) to JS. It allows your UI to react in a physically natural way to user's drag interactions. See it working in the [react-interactable playground](https://react-interactable.netlify.com/).

This library is for you if you want to have nice interaction animations in your:
* Multiplatform app using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).
* [Expo app](https://expo.io/) that you don't want to eject.
* React.js webapp, not a native one.

If you are building a well performant android/ios app with react-native, [react-native-interactable](https://github.com/wix/react-native-interactable) is a much better option than this library.

## Install
Just install via npm or yarn

If our project is using react-native-web:
```
npm install --save react-interactable
```

If we are using just plain React:
```
npm install --save react-interactable animated react-panresponder-web
```
